# Overview:
The Job Application Management System is a web-based application developed using Spring Boot that facilitates job seekers in applying for positions while ensuring secure access to the application. The system leverages Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization, enhancing user data protection and session management.

# Key Features:

# User Authentication:
The API endpoints are secured using Spring Security, requiring users to authenticate with their username and password.
Credentials are securely fetched from a database, ensuring that only authorized users can access the application.

# Dynamic Session Management:
Upon successful authentication, the system dynamically manages session IDs, changing them with each new request to enhance security.
This approach mitigates the risks associated with session fixation attacks, ensuring that user sessions remain secure and unique.

# RESTful API Endpoints:
The application provides a set of RESTful APIs that allow users to perform actions related to job applications, such as submitting applications, viewing job listings, and checking application status.
The design follows best practices in REST architecture, ensuring a clear and intuitive interface for users.

# Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):
The project implements Spring AOP to handle cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, exception handling, and security checks, in a modular fashion.
This separation of concerns improves code maintainability and enhances the overall structure of the application.

# Scalability and Maintainability:
Built on the Spring Boot framework, the application is designed for easy scalability and maintainability, allowing for future enhancements and additional features as needed.

# Technologies Used:
Spring Boot
Spring Security
Spring AOP
JPA/Hibernate for database interactions
MySQL or any relational database
# Conclusion:
The Job Application Management System is a secure and efficient solution for managing job applications. By integrating strong security measures and following best practices in software design, this project not only meets the current needs of job seekers but is also well-positioned for future growth and enhancements.
